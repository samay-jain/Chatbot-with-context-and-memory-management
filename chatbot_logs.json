Here's a general guideline:\n\n**Basic Instructions:**\n\n1. Boil water in a pot.\n2. Add 1-2 Maggi noodles (depending on serving size) to the boiling water.\n3. Stir well for about 2 minutes, or until the noodles are cooked.\n4. Add your favorite seasoning or sauce packet from the Maggi package.\n5. Stir well and serve hot.\n\n**Some Variations:**\n\n* You can also add some vegetables like onions, carrots, or green beans to the boiling water for extra flavor and nutrition.\n* If you prefer a spicy version, you can add some chili flakes or sliced chilies to your noodles.\n* For a more flavorful broth, you can use chicken or beef stock instead of plain water.\n\n**Some Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to follow the package instructions for the correct amount of water and cooking time.\n* You can also cook Maggi in a microwave-safe bowl with 1-2 cups of water for about 2-3 minutes.\n* Experiment with different seasoning packets or add your own favorite spices to create unique flavor combinations.\n\nI hope that helps, Samay!", "metadata": {"session_id": "5ba7f054-6627-4c9e-b7e1-8c669315d4b2", "model": "llama3.2", "response_time": 3.269206, "tokens_used": null}}
