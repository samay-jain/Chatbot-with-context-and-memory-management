Stir well for about 2 minutes, or until the noodles are cooked.\n4. Add your favorite seasoning or sauce packet from the Maggi package.\n5. Stir well and serve hot.\n\n**Some Variations:**\n\n* You can also add some vegetables like onions, carrots, or green beans to the boiling water for extra flavor and nutrition.\n* If you prefer a spicy version, you can add some chili flakes or sliced chilies to your noodles.\n* For a more flavorful broth, you can use chicken or beef stock instead of plain water.\n\n**Some Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to follow the package instructions for the correct amount of water and cooking time.\n* You can also cook Maggi in a microwave-safe bowl with 1-2 cups of water for about 2-3 minutes.\n* Experiment with different seasoning packets or add your own favorite spices to create unique flavor combinations.\n\nI hope that helps, Samay!", "metadata": {"session_id": "5ba7f054-6627-4c9e-b7e1-8c669315d4b2", "model": "llama3.2", "response_time": 3.269206, "tokens_used": null}}

The idea is to first retrieve relevant documents or passages from a large database and then use these retrieved texts as input to a generation machine.\n\nThe process works as follows:\n\n1. **Retrieve relevant documents**: Use a retriever model to select relevant documents or passages from a massive database.\n2. **Encode the retrieved documents**: Use an encoder model to extract features from the retrieved documents.\n3. **Generate text**: Use a generator model to generate new text based on the encoded features of the retrieved documents.\n\nRAG is designed to improve the performance of LLMs by leveraging the strengths of retrieval-based approaches and generation-based models simultaneously.\n\n**Key benefits of RAG**\n\n* **Improved relevance**: By retrieving relevant documents, RAG ensures that generated text is more informative and relevant.\n* **Increased diversity**: The use of retrieved documents can introduce new ideas and topics into generated text.\n* **Reducing repetition**: RAG's retrieval-based approach helps to reduce repetition in generated text.\n\nRAG has shown promising results on several benchmark tasks, including the GLUE dataset and the SuperGLUE dataset.
